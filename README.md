# Secure Remote Job Runner

The secure remote job runner uses mTLS to authenticate between a server and a client, so that the client can start and start jobs, query their status and stream their output locally.

## Getting Started
> TBD - This section will include setup instructions to start up both the client and the server, and instructions on how to verify functionality.
